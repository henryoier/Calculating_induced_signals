## Calculating_induced_signals  
This is an DIY process for brainstorm, which calculates the induced signal by using all total signals minus averaged signal(Evoked), and this process is modified from Difference: A - B.  

###You can add this process in your brainstorm by the following steps:  

#####1. Put 'panel_process2.m' to '$brainstrom_HOME/toolbox/process' to overwrite the previous one;  
#####2. Put 'process_diff_induce.m' to '$brainstrom_HOME/toolbox/process/functions';  
#####3. Then you can use this process in brainstorm interface;
